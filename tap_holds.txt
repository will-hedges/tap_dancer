*  Put the keycodes (anything after "KC_") for each tap and hold in this file
*  One TAP, HOLD pair per line, separated by a comma
*  The script will alphabetize them by tap keycode, so order does not matter here
*  
*  NOTE: this program will not check for valid QMK keycodes
*  See the QMK docs for valid keycodes: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes
